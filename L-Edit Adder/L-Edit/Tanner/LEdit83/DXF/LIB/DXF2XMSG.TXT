90

The program was unable to find it's own executable image  in  any
of the directories indicated by the PATH environment variable.

91

At start up the program determines from the zeroth  command  line
argument   whether   program  execution  depends  upon  the  PATH
environment variable or not.  If the full PATH is used to  invoke
the  program   it  will  assume  that  all the required files for
program execution will reside in the  indicated  directory.  This
message was generated because the program could not find the file
"standard.shx", a font required for the viewer.

92

At start up the program determines from the zeroth  command  line
argument   whether   program  execution  depends  upon  the  PATH
environment variable or not.  If the full PATH is used to  invoke
the  program   it  will  assume  that  all the required files for
program execution will reside in the  indicated  directory.  This
message was generated because the program could not find the file
"symbols.shx", a font required for the viewer,  and  is  used  to
emulate the HP font hp_Y14.5.

93

At start up the program determines from the zeroth  command  line
argument   whether   program  execution  depends  upon  the  PATH
environment variable or not.  If the full PATH is used to  invoke
the  program   it  will  assume  that  all the required files for
program execution will reside in the  indicated  directory.   The
program was unable to find the error message file "mechmsg.txt".

94

At start up the program determines from the zeroth  command  line
argument   whether   program  execution  depends  upon  the  PATH
environment variable or not.  If the full PATH is used to  invoke
the  program   it  will  assume  that  all the required files for
program execution will reside in the indicated  directory.   This
message  was generated because the program was unable to find the
program "vu2d", Artwork  Conversion  Software's  general  purpose
two-dimensional viewer.

95

At start up the program determines from the zeroth  command  line
argument   whether   program  execution  depends  upon  the  PATH
environment variable or not.  If the full PATH is used to  invoke
the  program   it  will  assume  that  all the required files for
program execution will reside in the indicated  directory.   This
message  was generated because the program was unable to find the
program "asmload.exe", a program  loader.   This  message  should
only occur on MS/PC DOS platforms.

96

This message  occurs  when  multiple  output  options  have  been
specified  on the command line. The only options that can be used
together are -dxf and -iges, otherwise the output  option  allows
only  one  option.  The options are:  -dxf, -egs, -gbr, -gds, and
-iges.

97

This error occurs because the program has attempted to  create  a
boundary  with more than the maximum of 200 vertices (in the case
of GDSII output)  or  1,024  vertices  (in  the  case  of  GERBER
output).  Data  loss will occur because the program will drop the
figure.  The -link option has been specified either because GDSII
output or GERBER output has been requested.


98

This message occurs when when the -link option has been turned on
(GDSII  or  GERBER output requested) and the program is unable to
open a temporary intermediate file called $CHAIN.DAT for writing.
This  may  be  the  result of a file protection problem, the file
being erased by another process, program, or user,  or  a  naming
conflict  caused  by  running another copy of the software in the
same directory.  This error will cause the program to quit.

99

The program is unable  to  allocate  memory  in  the  process  of
creating  chained  or  linked  data.  The  -link  option has been
specified because either GDSII output or GERBER output  has  been
requested.

100

The program  is  unable  to  open  an  intermediate  file  called
GBR_file.int  for  writing.   This  may  be  the result of a file
protection problem, the file being  erased  by  another  process,
program,  or user, or a naming conflict caused by running another
copy of the software in the  same  directory.   This  error  will
cause   the  program  to  quit.   (The  GERBER  option  has  been
specified.)

101

The program is unable to close the file GBR_file.int.   This  may
be the result of a file protection problem, the file being erased
by another process, program, or user, or a naming conflict caused
by  running  another  copy of the software in the same directory.
(The GERBER option has been specified.)

102

This message is issued because the program is unable to open  the
temporary  file  CFG.TMP for writing. This may be the result of a
file  protection  problem,  the  file  being  erased  by  another
process, program, or user, or a naming conflict caused by running
another copy of the software in the same directory.   This  error
will  cause  the  program  to  quit.  (The GERBER option has been
specified.)

103

This message is issued when a floating  point  exception  occurs.
This event has been trapped by the program and probably indicates
that the program is working on data that may have been  corrupted
or  created  incorrectly.  This  error will cause  the program to
exit.

104

This message is issued when a buss error occurs.  This event  has
been  trapped  by  the  program  and  probably indicates that the
program is working on  data  that  may  have  been  corrupted  or
created incorrectly.  This error will cause  the program to exit.

105

This message is issued when a  segment  violation  occurs.   This
event has been trapped by the program and probably indicates that
the program is working on data that may have  been  corrupted  or
created  incorrectly.   The  program has gone out of its own data
space to access data.

106

At start up the program determines from the zeroth  command  line
argument   whether   program  execution  depends  upon  the  PATH
environment variable or not.  If the full PATH is used to  invoke
the  program   it  will  assume  that  all the required files for
program execution will reside in the indicated  directory.   This
message was generated because the program could not find the file
"fixed.shx", a font required for the viewer.

113

At start up the program determines from the zeroth  command  line
argument   whether   program  execution  depends  upon  the  PATH
environment variable or not.  If the full PATH is used to  invoke
the  program   it  will  assume  that  all the required files for
program execution will reside in the indicated  directory.   This
message was generated because the program could not find the file
"block.shx", a font required for the viewer.

107

The program is unable to open the indicated GERBER aperture file.
This  may  be  the  result of a file protection problem, the file
being erased by another process, program, or user,  or  a  naming
conflict  caused  by  running another copy of the software in the
same directory. This usually occurs because  the  file  does  not
exist.  (The GERBER option has been specified.)

108

This message is issued because an error has occurred  in  reading
the  aperture  file.   The  file  was successfully opened but the
program is unable to  read  it.   (The  GERBER  option  has  been
specified.)

109

The -olist command line option has been specified  but  the  file
that  should follow -olist doesn't exist.  (The GERBER option has
been specified.)

110

The -olist command line option has been specified but the program
is  unable to open the file that follows -olist.  This may be the
result of a file protection problem, or a naming conflict  caused
by  running  another  copy of the software in the same directory.
(The GERBER option has been specified.)

111

An unspecified error has occurred in one or more of  the  command
line options.

112

At start up the program determines from the zeroth  command  line
argument   whether   program  execution  depends  upon  the  PATH
environment variable or not.  If the full PATH is used to  invoke
the  program   it  will  assume  that  all the required files for
program execution will reside in the indicated  directory.   This
message  was generated because the program was unable to find the
program "gdsx2gbr", Artwork Conversion Software's general purpose
GERBER engine which is required for MI to Gerber translation.

200

The -mlist command line option has been specified  but  the  file
that  should follow -mlist doesn't exist.  (The GERBER option has
been specified.)

201

The -mlist command line option has been specified but the program
is  unable to open the file that follows -mlist.  This may be the
result of a file protection problem, or a naming conflict  caused
by  running  another  copy of the software in the same directory.
(The GERBER option has been specified.)

202

The GERBER OUTLINE command line option  "-onN,M"  has  been  used
with the incorrect syntax.

114

The -llist command line option has been specified  but  the  file
that  should follow -llist doesn't exist.  (The GDS "-gds" option
has been specified.)

115

The -llist command line option has been specified but the program
is  unable to open the file that follows -llist.  This may be the
result of a file protection problem, or a naming conflict  caused
by  running  another  copy of the software in the same directory.
(The GDS "-gds" option has been specified.)


116

The requested output is not a supported option for this package.

516

An error occurred in parsing the DXF HEADER SECTION.

517

An error occurred in parsing the DXF TABLE SECTION.

518

The program was unable  to  further  alloc  any  more  memory  in
evaluating DXF POLYLINE data.

519

At start up the program determines from the zeroth  command  line
argument   whether   program  execution  depends  upon  the  PATH
environment variable or not.  If the full PATH is used to  invoke
the  program   it  will  assume  that  all the required files for
program execution will reside in the indicated  directory.   This
message  was generated because the program was unable to find the
program "gdx2mi", Artwork Conversion Software's MI output  module
which is required for MI output.

520

The file "linetype.map", used for line  type  mapping,  does  not
exist.

521

The file "linetype.map", used for line type mapping,  exists  but
the  program  was  unable to open it for reading. This may be the
result of a file protection problem.  At  start  up  the  program
determines  from the zeroth command line argument whether program
execution depends upon the PATH environment variable or not.   If
the  full PATH is used to invoke the program  it will assume that
all the required files for program execution will reside  in  the
indicated directory. The program looks for this file first in the
current directory,  then  in  places  determined  by  the  zeroth
command line argument or the PATH environment variable.
