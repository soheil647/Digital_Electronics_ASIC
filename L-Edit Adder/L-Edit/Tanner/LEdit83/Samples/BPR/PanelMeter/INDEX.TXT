             			Panel Meter
		The IC circuit under demonstration is commonly used in 
		   industrial process control applications. 

Features:
   * Internal controller implements a variety of process display functions. (Cell "Controlr")
   * 64-segments tri-color bargraph display. (Cell "Bargraph")
   * 16-segment, 4-point programmable annunciater. (Cell "Fingers")
   * 4-digit numerical display. (Cell "Number")
   * 12-bit Analog-to-Digital converter. (Cell "adc12b")
   * Analog amplifier and input circuitry. (Cell "Amp1")
   * Remote process monitoring.
   * Single 5-V power supply.

Applications:
   * Process-to-control interface.
   * Computer-to-process interface.
   * Complex engineering units conversion.
