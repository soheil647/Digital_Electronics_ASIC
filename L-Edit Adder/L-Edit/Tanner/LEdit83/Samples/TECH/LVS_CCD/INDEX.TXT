The files in this directory are for extracting CCD and depletion mode
MOSFET devices using L-Edit/EXT.  The files are for demonstration only.
For detailed illustrations of the methodology used to extracte CCD devices,
please read the article "CMOS & CCD Designs: Extraction & Verification",
pp.8~15, Tanner Tools Newsletter, Spring Issue '93.

Files: 

mORB20CC.TDB	An extraction example. It includes two cells: Cell mORB20CC is
		the layout of an output stage of a CCD imager, from which its
		SPICE netlist containing various CCD devices can be extracted.
		Cell CCD_Out is the schematic of Cell mORB20CC, for
		illustration only. This file can be also used as a technology
		setup file.

mORB20CC.EXT	Extraction definition file for MOSIS:Orbit N-Well 2.0um CCD
		process (with MOSIS scalable rules).

mORB20CC.ELM	CCD Element definition file for LVS verification using LVS.

mORB20CC.SPC	Netlist extracted from the example cell mORB20CC by L-Edit.

mORB20CC.CIR	Netlist output from the example schematic mORB20CC by
		ViewLogic.

lvs_ccd.vdb	LVS Setup file for verification of the example.

mORB20CC.out	Output of the LVS verification of the example.
