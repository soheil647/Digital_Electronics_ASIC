Files:
        
        index.txt        This file.
        bargraph_tpr.sdb S-Edit document containing the BARGRAPH design 
                         example. Used to generate TPR netlist.
        bargraph_edn.sdb S-Edit document containing the BARGRAPH design 
                         example. Used to generate EDIF netlist.
        bargraph.tdb     An L-Edit document containing the BARGRAPH layout.  
                         The toplevel cell (bargraph) was generated using
                         L-Edit/SPR with CLK/CLR (nets N15/N17) routed 
                         as global signals.
        gsr_lib.tdb      A library containing the minimum set of SCMOSLib
                         Standard Cells for use in standard cell place & route
                         of the BARGRAPH example (including Global Signal
                         Routing). This library supports MOSIS/ORbit N-Well
                         2.0um Process Technology.
        bargraph.tpr     A TPR netlist file for the BARGRAPH circuit.
        bargraph.edn     An EDIF netlist file for the BARGRAPH circuit.
        bargraph.cap     A nodal capacitance file for the BARGRAPH circuit,
                         generated by L-Edit/SPR.
        bargraph.sdf     An SDF file for the BARGRAPH circuit, generated
                         by L-Edit/SPR.
        morbn20.ext      An extraction definition file for L-Edit/Extract.
                         This process definition file supports MOSIS/Orbit
                         N-well 2.0um Process Technology.
        morbn20.xst      A cross-section definition file for L-Edit/Cross-
                         Section. This process definition file supports 
                         MOSIS/Orbit N-well 2.0um Process Technology.
