Files:

        index.txt       This file.
        lights_tpr.sdb  S-Edit document containing the LIGHTS design example.
                        Used to generate TPR netlist.
        lights_edn.sdb  S-Edit document containing the LIGHTS design example.
                        Used to generate EDIF netlist.
        lights.tdb      An L-Edit document containing the LIGHTS layout.
                        The top level cell (lights) was generated using
                        L-Edit/SPR.
        lightslb.tdb    A library containing the minimum set of SCMOSLib Standard
                        Cells for use in standard cell place & route of the
                        LIGHTS example.
        lights.tpr      A TPR netlist file for the LIGHTS circuit.
        lights.edn      An EDIF netlist file for the LIGHTS circuit.
        lights.cap      A nodal capacitance file for the LIGHTS circuit, generated
                        by L-Edit/SPR.
        lights.sdf      An SDF file for the LIGHTS circuit, generated by 
                        L-Edit/SPR.
        lights.ext      An extraction definition file for L-Edit/Extract.
