                      990 standard cells (3510 gates)
Files:
        
        index.txt        	This file.
        bargraph_tpr.sdb 	S-Edit document containing the BARGRAPH design 
                         	example. Used to generate TPR netlist.
        bargraph_edn.sdb 	S-Edit document containing the BARGRAPH design 
                         	example. Used to generate EDIF netlist.
        bargraph3layer.tdb 	An L-Edit document containing the BARGRAPH layout.  
                         	The toplevel cell (bargraph) was generated using
                         	L-Edit/SPR with 3 routing layers and over-the-
                                cell (OTC) routing enabled.
        gsr_lib_3layer.tdb     	A library containing the minimum set of SCMOSLib
                         	Standard Cells for use in standard cell place & route
                         	of the BARGRAPH example (including Global Signal
                         	Routing). This library supports MOSIS/HP N-Well
                         	0.5um Process Technology.
        bargraph.tpr     	A TPR netlist file for the BARGRAPH circuit.
        bargraph.edn     	An EDIF netlist file for the BARGRAPH circuit.
        bargraph3layer.cap     	A nodal capacitance file for the BARGRAPH circuit,
                                generated by L-Edit/SPR with 3-layer routing.
        bargraph3layer.sdf     	An SDF file for the BARGRAPH circuit, generated
                         	by L-Edit/SPR with 3-layer routing.
        mhp_n05.ext      	An extraction definition file for L-Edit/Extract.
                         	This process definition file supports MOSIS/HP
                         	N-well 0.5um Process Technology.
        mhp_n05.xst      	A cross-section definition file for L-Edit/Cross-
                         	Section. This process definition file supports 
                         	MOSIS/HP N-well 0.5um Process Technology.
